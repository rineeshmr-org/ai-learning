To get you up and running quickly, we have a pre-built Workflow called the `AgentWorkflow` that handles a lot of common agent use cases and allows you to focus on the specifics of your implementation. Later, we drop down one level to Workflows themselves and show how to build one from scratch.\n",

Glossary of computer science Category vte The World Wide Web (\"WWW\", \"W3\" or simply \"the Web\") is a global information medium that users can access via computers connected to the Internet. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working at CERN in 1989. [1][2] He developed the first web server, the first web browser, and a document formatting protocol, called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). After publishing the markup language in 1991, and releasing the browser source code for public use in 1993, many other web browsers were soon developed, with Marc Andreessen\\'s Mosaic (later Netscape Navigator), being particularly easy to use and install, and often credited with sparking the Internet boom of the 1990s. This spurred competition in server and browser software, highlighted in the Browser wars which was initially dominated by Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer.', 'score': 0.73981786, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': 'History of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW)', 'url': 'https://www.encyclopedia.com/economics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/history-internet-and-world-wide-web-www', 'content': 'History of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) | Encyclopedia.com History of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) History of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) HISTORY OF THE INTERNET AND WORLD WIDE WEB (WWW) \"History of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) .\" Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce. \"History of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) .\" Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce. https://www.encyclopedia.com/economics/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/history-internet-and-world-wide-web-www \"History of the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW) .\" Gale Encyclopedia of E-Commerce. .

            "            Came up with answer: San Francisco has faced significant challenges in urban development and housing throughout its history due to several factors. The city has a severely constrained development potential because it occupies roughly 47 square miles on the tip of a peninsula, limiting its ability to expand through bay infill or annexation. It is largely \"built out,\" with almost all available land already developed. This limited land capacity has made it difficult to increase housing supply.\n",
            "\n",
            "Historically, San Francisco has undergone intense periods of city building, notably after the California Gold Rush, following the 1906 earthquake and fire, and during the rise of the modern high-rise city in the mid-20th century. Despite these rebuilding efforts, the city has struggled with affordable housing production. Affordable housing has primarily been produced by nonprofit developers, the San Francisco Housing Authority, and market-rate developers, but demand has often outpaced supply.\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, urban renewal efforts in the past led to displacement and loss of low-rent private housing stock, exacerbating housing challenges for lower-income residents.

            "Received question How does San Francisco’s history compare to other major cities in California and the United States?\n",
            "            Came up with answer: San Francisco's history is distinctive and influential both within California and the broader United States. Founded originally as a Spanish mission and presidio in the late 18th century, it quickly grew from a small village called Yerba Buena into California's major seaport by the mid-19th century, especially after the Gold Rush of 1848-49. This event triggered rapid population growth and economic development, making San Francisco a key commercial hub on the West Coast. The completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 further connected San Francisco to the rest of the country, enhancing its role in trade and migration.\n",
            "\n",
            "San Francisco has experienced significant challenges and transformations, including the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire, which destroyed much of the city but did not halt its growth. Throughout the 20th century, it became a center of wealth, military power, progressive culture, and technological innovation. The city is also known for its diverse culture and progressive social movements, including the Beatniks in the 1950s and later the counterculture movements.\n",
            "\n",
            "Compared to other major California cities like Los Angeles, which was founded earlier (1781) and grew into the state's largest city with a focus on entertainment and sprawling urban development, San Francisco has maintained a unique identity tied to its geography, history of immigration, and role as a financial and technological hub. Other California cities like San Diego and Sacramento have different historical trajectories, often tied to military, governmental, or regional economic roles.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the context of U.S. cities, San Francisco's history is notable for its rapid growth during the Gold Rush, its recovery from natural disasters, and its role in westward expansion and technological innovation. While cities like Boston and New York have longer colonial histories dating back to the 17th century and played central roles in early American history and industrialization, San Francisco represents the dynamic growth of the American West and the integration of diverse cultures and economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n",

            "Overall, San Francisco's history is marked by rapid growth, resilience in the face of disaster, cultural diversity, and economic innovation, distinguishing it from other major cities in California and across the United States.\n",

            "Long before European colonization, the area now known as San Francisco was inhabited for at least 13,500 years by the Ramaytush Ohlone people, specifically the Yelamu group. The indigenous name for the region was *Ahwaste*, meaning \"place at the bay.\" The Ohlone lived in a network of bands extending from south of the Golden Gate to San José, stewarding the land and its rich natural resources with deep cultural significance.\n",
            "\n",
            "European settlement began in 1776 when Spanish colonizers established the Presidio of San Francisco on September 17 and founded Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores) to convert native peoples to Christianity. This marked the beginning of San Francisco’s transformation from indigenous territory to a colonial outpost.\n",

            "The 19th century was a period of rapid growth and transformation for San Francisco, driven primarily by the California Gold Rush beginning in 1848. The discovery of gold attracted a massive influx of people from around the world, turning San Francisco from a small settlement into a bustling commercial hub almost overnight. The city’s population swelled, and its economy diversified as it became the primary supply and commercial center for mining regions.\n",

They lived along the San Francisco Peninsula for at least 13,500 years and were the stewards of the land that is now San Francisco County. Additionally, the Yelamu, a group of the Ramaytush Ohlone, were specifically associated with the San Francisco area. The Ohlone people, also known as Costanoans, along with the Coastal Miwok, inhabited the broader San Francisco Bay region and relied on the coastal waters and marshes for food and resources.\n",

The indigenous name for San Francisco was Ahwaste, meaning \"place at the bay.\" The Ohlone were part of a contiguous set of bands living from south of the Golden Gate to San José, and they did not recognize the later imposed city or county boundaries. The earliest inhabitants' exact origins are unclear, but they were the ancestors of the Ohlone population encountered by the Spanish in the late 18th century. The region was rich in natural resources and had a deep cultural significance for these native peoples long before European explorers arrived.\n",

            "\n",
            "In the aftermath, the city underwent large-scale redevelopment efforts. The destruction removed barriers to redevelopment in many areas, leading to changes in land use and higher residential density in the razed parts of the city. The event also prompted revisions in building codes and advancements in earthquake preparedness and seismology, influencing how cities in earthquake-prone areas prepare for and respond to seismic events.\n",

            "            Came up with answer: The California Gold Rush had a profound impact on the growth and development of San Francisco. Before the Gold Rush, San Francisco was a small, sleepy port town. The discovery of gold in 1848 transformed it almost overnight into a booming city filled with makeshift tent-houses, hotels, stores, saloons, gambling halls, and shanties. The Gold Rush attracted a remarkably diverse population of prospectors, entrepreneurs, and settlers eager to capitalize on the opportunities, which led to rapid population growth and economic expansion.\n",
            "\n",
            "San Francisco became a hub of entrepreneurial activity, supplying miners and serving as a gateway for goods and people heading to the goldfields. This rapid growth forced the city to expand its infrastructure and services quickly. The influx of wealth and people also expedited California's admission into the Union as a state in 1850.

            "\n",
            "1. Economic and Industry Shift: San Francisco and the surrounding Bay Area, including Silicon Valley, evolved from a region of orchards, farmland, and small townships into the global epicenter of the technology industry. The rise of Silicon Valley as a hub for technological innovation, entrepreneurship, and venture capital investment positioned the area as the world’s tech capital.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Urban and Demographic Changes: The influx of tech companies and workers led to significant urban development and gentrification in San Francisco. The city experienced a surge in real estate demand, driving up housing prices and rents. This gentrification often displaced long-time residents and altered the socio-economic fabric of neighborhoods.\n",

For much of its existence, maritime activities were the most important economic sector in San Francisco, with many residents working directly or indirectly in this field. The open piers and waterfront were highly visible public spaces that connected the broader society with maritime labor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Historically, the port served as a major hub for shipping and trade, including significant imports such as coffee from Central and South America, Mexico, and Africa. The waterfront infrastructure, including seawalls, bulkhead wharves, and piers, is recognized as a rare and important engineering heritage.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the mid-20th century, the port was a bustling center of cargo handling, with longshoremen playing a key role in loading and unloading ships. The advent of containerization in the 1960s and 1970s transformed maritime work, reducing the number of cargo-handling jobs but increasing efficiency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although the Port of Oakland now handles the majority of containerized goods in Northern California, San Francisco's port remains historically significant and continues to be a major waterfront attraction. The Embarcadero Historic District, which includes much of the port area, is preserved as a historic and cultural asset, contributing to the city's identity and tourism economy.\n",

Originally inhabited by indigenous peoples, the area saw Spanish colonization in the late 18th century. The city's political development was shaped by rapid growth following the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, which connected San Francisco to the rest of the United States and boosted its role as a commercial hub.\n",

After the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833, mission lands were secularized, which meant that the vast mission holdings were broken up and redistributed. However, only a few mission Indians were granted land, while the majority of indigenous people fled the missions and became an exploited laboring class on Mexican ranchos across the state. This secularization dispersed the remaining indigenous populations, dismantling their families and tribal structures. The indigenous communities faced extreme poverty, poor health care, substandard education, and unemployment, problems that have persisted to the present day. Land use shifted from mission-controlled communal lands to private ranchos, often controlled by Mexican landowners, which marginalized indigenous peoples from their ancestral territories. Despite these disruptions, some indigenous lineages and families survived, though their traditional knowledge and social structures were severely weakened.\n",

            "            Came up with answer: Spanish colonization had a profound and devastating impact on the indigenous populations and their cultures in San Francisco. By 1801, nearly all native people of the San Francisco Peninsula had been brought into Mission Dolores, where about eighty percent of the indigenous population died due to disease, harsh living conditions, and disruption of their traditional ways of life. The mission system dismantled indigenous families and tribes, leading to significant population decline and cultural loss. After the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833, only a few mission Indians were granted land, while most fled the missions and became exploited laborers on Spanish and Mexican ranchos. Despite this, some indigenous lineages and tribes survived but faced ongoing challenges such as extreme poverty, poor healthcare, substandard education, and unemployment. The Spanish imposed their language, Catholic religion, and social structures, which led to the erosion of indigenous languages, religious practices, and cultural traditions. Overall, Spanish colonization resulted in demographic collapse, cultural transformation through forced assimilation, and economic disruption for the native peoples of the San Francisco area.\n",

            "\n",
            "The Gold Rush, beginning in 1848, transformed San Francisco from a small settlement into a booming city almost overnight. News of gold discovery attracted a massive influx of people from across the United States and around the world, including immigrants from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and China. This rapid migration caused San Francisco's population to swell dramatically; by 1850, California was admitted as a state largely due to this population boom. The city became a hub of entrepreneurial activity, supplying miners and capitalizing on the economic opportunities created by the rush. The Gold Rush also established California as a cultural mosaic and accelerated westward expansion.\n",

            "The completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 further accelerated San Francisco's growth by connecting the city to the rest of the country. This infrastructure development facilitated easier and faster migration, encouraging more immigrants to settle in San Francisco and other parts of California. By 1900, nearly 40% of San Francisco's population was foreign-born, reflecting the city's role as a major immigration gateway. The railroad also stimulated economic development, creating jobs and attracting workers, including many immigrants, which fueled urbanization and population growth.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Chinese Exclusion Act (1882): This was the first U.S. law to prohibit immigration based on ethnicity, specifically targeting Chinese immigrants. It severely restricted Chinese immigration to San Francisco and the U.S., leading to a stunted growth of the Chinese population and shaping the development of San Francisco's Chinatown as a segregated ethnic enclave. The act was renewed and made permanent in the early 1900s, reinforcing racial discrimination and limiting Chinese community growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Angel Island Immigration Station (1910-1940): Located in San Francisco Bay, this station served as the main immigration processing center on the West Coast. It detained and interrogated immigrants, especially those from Asia, including an estimated 100,000 Chinese and tens of thousands of Japanese immigrants. The station's strict screening and detention policies reflected and reinforced exclusionary immigration laws, impacting the flow and composition of Asian immigrants entering San Francisco.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Immigration Act of 1924 (Johnson-Reed Act): This federal law established national origins quotas that drastically limited immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and completely excluded Asian immigrants. It reflected nativist and xenophobic attitudes and significantly altered the ethnic makeup of immigrants arriving in San Francisco by curtailing groups previously arriving in large numbers.\n",
            "\n",

The immediate catalyst for transformation was the California Gold Rush beginning in 1848, which triggered a massive influx of migrants from across the United States and around the world. This rapid population growth turned San Francisco from a small Mexican settlement into a booming economic and cultural hub.\n",
            "\n",
            "Economically, the Gold Rush spurred unprecedented growth. San Francisco became the primary port and commercial center for the gold mining regions, attracting investment, businesses, and infrastructure development.

The wealth generated accelerated industrial growth and urban development, laying the foundation for San Francisco’s future as a major economic powerhouse.\n",

            "\n",
            "Culturally, American governance imposed new political and legal institutions, replacing Mexican systems and promoting Anglo-American cultural norms. The city’s cultural identity evolved with influences from its diverse immigrant communities, but also through the dominance of American political power and economic interests. The Gold Rush era accelerated cultural exchange but also led to the marginalization of indigenous and Mexican Californian cultures.\n",

            "\n",
            "Socially, the Ramaytush were organized into tribelets or villages, each led by a head or chief.

For example, the district leader Luciano Tiburcio was based at the village of Pruristac in the Aramai tribelet.\n",

            "            Came up with answer: San Francisco's natural environment and waterfront have undergone significant changes over time due to urban development and ecological factors. Historically, the waterfront was a natural shoreline with wetlands, sloughs, and tidal marshes. Urban development, especially since the California Gold Rush and subsequent city expansions, transformed much of this natural landscape into industrial piers, shipping docks, and urban infrastructure. The construction of the Embarcadero and the filling in of wetlands altered the natural hydrology and habitats.\n",
            "\n",
            "The seawall, built over 100 years ago, protects the city’s waterfront but is now in need of reinforcement due to aging and increasing threats from earthquakes and sea-level rise. Urban development has led to the loss of natural habitats and increased ecological stress on the bay area. The waterfront has also been physically separated from the city by infrastructure like the Embarcadero Freeway (removed in 1991), which had created barriers to public access.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ecologically, the area faces challenges from climate change, including sea-level rise projected to be about 55 inches (140 cm) by the end of the century, threatening urban development and natural habitats. Restoration efforts are underway in areas like Yosemite Slough and Islais Creek to improve ecological resilience and access. The city is also implementing resilience programs such as the Embarcadero Seawall resilience program to protect against flooding and erosion.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, San Francisco’s waterfront has shifted from a natural coastal ecosystem to a heavily urbanized and industrialized zone, with ongoing efforts to balance urban development with ecological restoration and climate resilience.\n",

            "            Came up with answer: Transportation developments beyond cable cars and railroads, such as highways and public transit systems, have significantly influenced San Francisco's urban growth and connectivity in several ways:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Highways: The construction of highways like the Central Freeway in the 1950s connected key parts of the city, such as linking the Bayshore/James Lick Freeway (US 101) to the city center. While highways facilitated automobile traffic and regional connectivity, they also impacted the urban landscape and neighborhoods, sometimes dividing communities and shaping patterns of development. Efforts like the Connect4SSF Project aim to improve connections between neighborhoods historically divided by highways and other infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Public Transit Systems: San Francisco's public transit system, managed by agencies like SFMTA, has been shaped by policies at multiple government levels and integrates transit with urban development, housing, and climate change goals.

San Francisco became a hub for tech startups, venture capital firms, and service providers supporting the tech economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Socially, the relationship has been complex and transformative. The influx of tech workers and wealth from Silicon Valley has reshaped San Francisco's urban landscape, contributing to gentrification and rising living costs. This has led to tensions around housing affordability, displacement of long-time residents, and changes in the city's cultural fabric. The tech sector's presence has also influenced social dynamics, with new communities forming around the industry but also highlighting issues of income inequality and social stratification. The Bay Area as a whole, including both San Francisco and Silicon Valley, reflects a blend of innovation-driven growth and the challenges of managing rapid economic and social change.\n",

Under Mexican control from 1821 to 1846, San Francisco, then known as Yerba Buena, was a small but growing settlement centered around the Presidio and the Mission. The Mexican government secularized the missions, redistributing land through large land grants (ranchos) to private individuals, which shaped land ownership patterns. The Presidio community expanded beyond its original Spanish fortifications, and trade restrictions were relaxed, allowing more local commerce. Mexican rule also saw the development of ranching and agriculture in the area. However, the population remained small and the settlement was relatively undeveloped compared to later American growth. The Mexican period ended in 1846 when U.S. forces occupied San Francisco during the Mexican-American War, raising the American flag and beginning the transition to American governance.\n",

The Spanish established missions, such as Mission Dolores in 1776, with the goal of converting Native peoples into loyal Spanish citizens. This mission system disrupted traditional Ohlone social structures, suppressed their languages and cultural practices, and introduced diseases that decimated their populations. By 1801, nearly all native people of the San Francisco Peninsula had been incorporated into Mission Dolores, and about eighty percent of the indigenous population had died. After the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833, only a few mission Indians were granted land, while most were displaced and became exploited laborers on Spanish and Mexican ranchos. The missionization process dismantled families and tribes, leading to extreme poverty, poor health care, substandard education, and unemployment among the surviving indigenous peoples—challenges that persist to this day. Despite these hardships, some Ohlone lineages and tribes survived, maintaining a degree of cultural identity amid ongoing adversity.\n",

They faced pressures to assimilate into mainstream American society, which included shifts from communal landholding to individual land ownership, Christian worship, and formal education, especially through boarding schools that forbade native languages and traditions. This assimilation disrupted traditional social structures and cultural practices.\n",

Historically, neighborhoods like Bayview-Hunters Point, a predominantly Black community, were bordered by industrial facilities and a toxic military base, leading to long-term exposure to pollution and environmental hazards. Residents faced multi-generational challenges related to housing, health, and environmental contamination. These communities often experienced slower toxic waste cleanups and were disproportionately exposed to air pollution and environmental stressors due to proximity to industrial sites and freeways. Additionally, urban renewal efforts in the 1960s led to displacement through bulldozers and eviction notices, exacerbating social and environmental inequities.

Historically, maritime transport connected cities through extensive trade networks, such as those of the Hanseatic League and Italian and Asian city-states, which acted as systems of interconnected urban centers. These networks enabled the flow of goods, labor, and capital, contributing to the economic vitality and expansion of port cities. The presence of navigable waters influenced urban planning and architecture, with port cities often serving as important nodes in global maritime markets. The labor involved in maritime activities supported the operation and growth of these trade networks, reinforcing the city's role in regional and global commerce. Additionally, the interaction between ports and their cities shaped urban development, sometimes leading to conflicts but also opportunities for waterfront redevelopment and stronger integration between maritime functions and urban life.

            "Spanish colonization began in 1776 with the establishment of Mission Dolores, aiming to convert the Ohlone and other indigenous peoples to Christianity and integrate them into the colonial economy. This mission system profoundly disrupted indigenous social structures, suppressed native languages and cultural practices, and introduced diseases that decimated populations—by 1801, about 80% of the indigenous population had died. The missionization process dismantled families and tribes, leading to poverty, poor health, and unemployment among survivors. After the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833, most indigenous people were displaced and exploited as laborers on ranchos, with only a few granted land.\n",

The Mexican government secularized missions and redistributed land through large ranchos, shaping land ownership patterns. Trade restrictions were relaxed, fostering local commerce, and ranching and agriculture developed. However, the population remained small and the settlement relatively undeveloped compared to later American growth. Mexican rule ended in 1846 when U.S. forces occupied the area during the Mexican-American War, raising the American flag and initiating American governance.\n",

            "San Francisco’s Chinatown, the oldest in North America, emerged during the Gold Rush despite facing discrimination and exclusionary laws. It has preserved Chinese cultural traditions through institutions like the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association and landmarks such as the Great Star Theater. Economically, Chinatown developed a self-sufficient commercial ecosystem with shops, restaurants, and import-export businesses, contributing significantly to local commerce and tourism. Despite setbacks like the 1906 earthquake, Chinatown remains a vibrant cultural and economic center.\n",

Maritime labor and trade networks connected the city globally, fostering economic growth and a diverse population. Although the port’s shipping role diminished over time, its historic waterfront remains a cultural and economic landmark.\n",
